# Deryk.co.uk

This is the source code for [deryk.co.uk](https://www.deryk.co.uk).

Written in [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) which is built on the strong foundations of React, makes it very easy to implement modern features such as Progressive Web App support, and has the benefits of blazing performance and strong security that come from the recent resurgence in static website generation.

With Gatsby installed and its requirements (node.js and git), you can use git to
clone the repository, `npm install` to install the requirements and then
`gatsby develop` to play with your own copy.  I only ask that you kindly
replace any content and images with your own before distributing (not that I
  see much reason why you would want my logo or mugshot!)
